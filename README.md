# Deep-learning

Recognizing multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level

To build a python/Keras/TF code for image classification to understand the nitty-gritty of building and training a neural network model from scratch and further understand the advantages of neural networks over. We will learn the practical aspects of implementing these model including data preprocessing, augmentation, Dropout to regularize networks, weight initializations, hyperparameter tuning, learning rate decay.

Skills and Tools:

Neural Networks, Supervised Machine Learning, Deep Learning, image classification
